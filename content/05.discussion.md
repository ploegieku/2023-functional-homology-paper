## Discussion

- Paragraph 1: K-mer homology enables the identification of homologs across distantly related species

    - We used a simplified representation of protein sequence by compressing the 20-letter protein alphabet into a binarized form and using subsampled 24 amino acid-long k-mers
    - We applied the method to the Quest for Orthologs dataset, and were able to identify putative homologs across large evolutionary distances (~___mya) and outperformed existing methods for orthology detection.
    - To demonstrate utility of the binarized k-mer representation, we applied the method to a long-standing question in adaptive immunity â€“ when did it originate?
    - While genes may still be lineage-specific, k-mer homology is a sensitive method to identify putative homologs across huge evolutionary distances.
